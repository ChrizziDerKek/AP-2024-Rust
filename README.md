# AP-2024-Rust
Software developer final exam 2024 implementation in Rust.

This implementation was part of my final exam and while I originally implemented it in C#, I also decided to implement it in Rust to learn that language.

# Task definition
- Your company created a wooden puzzle with a cubic box and multiple layers
- There are puzzle pieces with the same length as the box and the width 1
- If the box length and width is n, a piece will also have n cells
- These cells can be empty or contain a hole on both sides or a hemisphere on either one or both sides
